\cvpn
\csearchword
```

```
i insert before symbol
A appedn to end of line
d$ - delete to end
        w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
        e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
        $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.
        ^ - home of line

dd -delete line
2dd -delete 2 lines

U AND u - UNDO
```
