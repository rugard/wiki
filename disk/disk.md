# Control disk devices.

## Device avaibility

**Remove drive from system (sata and esata approved).**
First unmount all partitions from the device

```bash
sync && echo 1 > /sys/block/sdX/device/delete
```

**Park heads, sleep drive until there is no access to the drive.!**

```bash
hdparm -Y /dev/sdd
```

This will delete device from kernel. You will need to reinitialize device on the bus.

**Find out drive state:**

```bash
hdparm -C /dev/sdX
```
**Scan system bus for new devices**

```bash
apt-get install scsitools
rescan-scsi-bus
```
