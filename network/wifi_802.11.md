| -30 dBm         | Max achievable signal strength. The client can only be a few feet from the AP to achieve this. Not typical or desirable in the real world. | N/A                          |
| -67 dBm         | Minimum signal strength for applications that require very reliable, timely packet delivery.                                               | VoIP/VoWiFi, streaming video |
| -70 dBm         | Minimum signal strength for reliable packet delivery.                                                                                      | Email, web                   |
| -80 dBm         | Minimum signal strength for basic connectivity. Packet delivery may be unreliable.                                                         | N/A                          |
| -90 dBm         | Approaching or drowning in the noise floor. Any functionality is highly unlikely.                                                          | N/A                          |
